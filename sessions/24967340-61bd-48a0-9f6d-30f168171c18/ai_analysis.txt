**Alignment Summary:**
The candidate's resume demonstrates a strong background in business analysis, ERP implementations, and reporting optimization, which aligns well with the People Analytics Implementation Lead role's requirement for experience in implementing analytics or reporting solutions. The candidate has over 10 years of experience in business transformation and has worked with ERP systems in Finance and HR, relevant to the job's emphasis on HR data systems. Their proficiency with Power BI and experience in stakeholder engagement and workshop facilitation are also strengths that match the job description's requirements for data analytics, visualization, and collaboration skills. However, there are notable gaps in the resume, such as the lack of explicit mention of experience with People Analytics software, and the absence of specific tools like One Model, Zendesk, or Smartsheet. Additionally, the resume does not clearly indicate experience with leading customers through data integration projects or creating and maintaining project schedules, which are critical responsibilities of the role.

**Clarification Questions:**
1. Can you provide examples of when you have led customers or stakeholders through the initial setup of an application, specifically focusing on data integration and user training, which are key responsibilities of the People Analytics Implementation Lead role?
2. Have you had any experience with People Analytics software, particularly in an implementation consultant capacity? If so, could you detail this experience and how it relates to the responsibilities outlined in the job description?
3. The job description mentions the importance of collaborating with cross-functional teams, including Product and Engineering. Can you describe any past projects where you worked closely with these types of teams, especially in the context of testing and implementing new features or products?
4. Could you quantify the impact of any past projects on customer success, such as through improved data accuracy, increased user adoption, or other metrics relevant to the People Analytics Implementation Lead position?
5. The role requires managing a range of tasks and dealing with ambiguity. Can you discuss a time when you had to design and enable processes "as you go," and how you ensured successful project delivery under such circumstances?
