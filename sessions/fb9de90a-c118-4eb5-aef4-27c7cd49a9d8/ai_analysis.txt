**Alignment Summary:** The candidate's resume does not align well with the key requirements of the Identity Access Manager role outlined in the job description. While the candidate demonstrates strong project and program management skills, regulatory change experience, and a background in IT project delivery, there is a lack of specific experience or skills related to identity and access management, access control processes, and familiarity with access management tools like Okta. The resume emphasizes strategic leadership and change management rather than technical expertise in access control models and tools, which are crucial for the Identity Access Manager position. To enhance alignment with the job description, the candidate should highlight any relevant experience or certifications in access control and security technologies.

**Clarification Questions:**
1. Can you provide specific examples of your experience in managing access control processes, defining access responsibilities, or optimizing access models within your previous roles?
2. Have you worked with any access management tools or software such as Okta in your previous positions, and if so, what specific tasks or projects did you undertake using these tools?
3. Do you possess any certifications related to access control models or cybersecurity, and how have these certifications contributed to your proficiency in managing access rights and ensuring compliance with security protocols?
