**Alignment Summary:**
The candidate's resume showcases a strong background in data analysis, reporting, and governance, which aligns well with the analytical aspects of the People Analytics Implementation Lead role. Their experience in leading analytics processes, managing large datasets, and providing actionable insights demonstrates proficiency in handling data-related tasks. However, there are notable gaps in direct experience with People Analytics implementation, HR data systems like Workday or SuccessFactors, and specific responsibilities outlined in the job description such as data integration, metric and storyboard build, and customer validation support. To enhance alignment, the candidate could consider highlighting any experience with implementation consulting, exposure to HR data systems, and specific examples of successful data project implementations.

**Clarification Questions:**
1. Can you provide specific examples of your experience in leading customers through the implementation of new datasets or data projects, including any documentation, metric building, or customer validation processes you have been involved in?
2. Have you worked on any projects involving the integration of new data sources or systems, particularly in the context of HR data systems like Workday or SuccessFactors? How did you ensure the successful integration and testing of these new data sources?
3. Could you quantify the impact of your data reporting and governance initiatives in previous roles, especially in terms of improved decision-making, process efficiency, or stakeholder engagement?
