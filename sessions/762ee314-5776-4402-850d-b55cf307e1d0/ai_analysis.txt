**Alignment Summary:** The candidate's resume showcases a strong background in business transformation, reporting optimization, and ERP implementations, which align well with the emphasis on process improvement, access management, and system specifications highlighted in the job description for the Identity Access Manager role. The candidate's experience in stakeholder engagement, requirements gathering, and facilitating workshops could be valuable for communicating with application administrators and defining access responsibilities. However, there are notable gaps in direct experience with access control models like RBAC and specific access management tools such as Okta, which are key requirements for the role. To enhance alignment, the resume could benefit from highlighting any relevant experience with access management processes, security protocols, and compliance frameworks.
