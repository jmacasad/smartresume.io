**Alignment Summary:**
The candidate's resume demonstrates a strong background in change management and operational readiness within the financial services sector, showcasing experience in leading end-to-end implementation of operational changes, conducting impact assessments, and coordinating stakeholder communication. The resume aligns well with the job description's emphasis on change management strategies, stakeholder engagement, and readiness assessments. Additionally, the candidate's experience in coordinating business support for project-based changes and facilitating workshops to validate impacts reflects relevant skills required for the Regional OCM Lead role. However, the resume lacks specific mentions of creating actionable deliverables like communication plans, training plans, and resistance management plans, which are key responsibilities outlined in the job description. To enhance alignment, the candidate could consider highlighting experience with SAP transformations or using specific change management methodologies like Prosci.
