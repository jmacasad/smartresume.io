**Alignment Summary:** The candidate's resume showcases extensive experience in project management within ICT environments, demonstrating proficiency in overseeing complex digital and enterprise projects. While the resume highlights skills in vendor and stakeholder engagement, project lifecycle management, and risk mitigation, there are notable gaps in direct experience related to identity access management, access control processes, and specific access management tools mentioned in the job description such as Okta.
