Key Matching Areas:
The resume aligns with the job description in terms of the candidate's experience in managing regulatory transformation, supporting end-to-end ICT delivery, and facilitating workshops to gather and document business requirements. The candidate also has experience in defining and maintaining business process workflows, which is relevant to the role of an Identity Access Manager who needs to manage and organise access control processes. Additionally, the resume highlights the candidate's experience in delivering projects using Agile methodologies, which is important for optimising access models and improving security protocols as mentioned in the job description.

Gaps or Missing Skills/Experience:
One of the gaps in the resume compared to the job description is the lack of specific experience or mention of identity access management tools and software such as Okta. The job description specifically mentions the need for experience with access management tools, which the resume does not highlight. Additionally, while the resume showcases the candidate's experience in managing regulatory transformation and compliance projects, it does not explicitly mention experience with access control models like Access Matrix and RBAC, which are key requirements for the Identity Access Manager role.

Suggestions for Improvement:
To improve alignment with the job description, the candidate could consider adding specific examples or projects where they have worked with access management tools such as Okta or have experience with access control models like Access Matrix and RBAC. Including these details in the resume would demonstrate a stronger match with the requirements of the Identity Access Manager role. Additionally, the candidate could highlight any relevant certifications related to access management or security, as the job description mentions that certifications like CISSP are a plus. By showcasing relevant certifications or training in the field of identity access management, the candidate could further strengthen their candidacy for the role.
