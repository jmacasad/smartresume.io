Hiring Team
 QBE Insurance Group
Dear Hiring Team,
I am writing to express my interest in the Project Manager position within your Managed Fund Claims Business. With over a decade of experience managing complex transformation initiatives across insurance, energy, and shared services, I bring the leadership, structure, and adaptability needed to drive high-impact projects at QBE.
Throughout my career, I have consistently delivered results across multi-stream programs, particularly in highly regulated environments. At AIG Australia, I led the modernization of underwriting and claims systems and implemented a Power BI reporting suite that improved executive insights by 30%. At EnergyAustralia, I spearheaded enterprise-wide regulatory compliance projects, developing governance frameworks and driving seamless adoption across business units. These experiences have honed my ability to manage dependencies, drive stakeholder alignment, and ensure timely, cost-effective delivery.
Key strengths I bring to this role include:
Proven success managing multi-stakeholder, cross-functional projects under pressure
Expertise in Agile and hybrid delivery models with hands-on governance and reporting experience
Strong communication and coaching skills, particularly when engaging senior leadership
Ability to turn strategic goals into executable, measurable outcomes
I’m passionate about enabling business improvement and confident my experience aligns perfectly with QBE’s commitment to operational excellence and stakeholder value. I am available to start immediately and would welcome the opportunity to contribute to QBE’s continued success.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to speak with you further.
Warm regards,
 Jayson Macasadia
