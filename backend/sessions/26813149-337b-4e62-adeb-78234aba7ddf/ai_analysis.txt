Key Matching Areas:
The resume aligns well with the job description in terms of the candidate's extensive experience in business analysis, regulatory compliance, and stakeholder management. The candidate has a proven track record of gathering and documenting business requirements, managing regulatory transformation projects, and supporting end-to-end ICT delivery. These skills are directly relevant to the responsibilities outlined in the job description, such as managing access control processes, communicating with application administrators, and maintaining access catalogs.

Gaps or Missing Skills/Experience:
One of the key missing skills in the resume is specific experience in identity access management (IAM) and access control models such as Access Matrix and RBAC. The job description requires a minimum of 6 years of experience in a similar role, which the candidate's resume does not explicitly mention. Additionally, the resume does not list any certifications related to access management tools or security protocols, which are mentioned as a plus in the job description. The candidate may also lack experience with specific access management software like Okta, which is mentioned in the job ad.

Suggestions for Improvement:
To improve alignment with the job description, the candidate could consider highlighting any experience or projects related to identity access management, access control models, or security protocols in their resume. They could also consider obtaining relevant certifications such as CISSP or CIAM to demonstrate their expertise in this area. Additionally, the candidate could mention any experience with access management tools or software, even if it is not specifically listed in the job description, to showcase their familiarity with relevant technologies. Overall, the candidate should tailor their resume to emphasize their experience and skills that directly align with the key responsibilities and requirements outlined in the job ad.
